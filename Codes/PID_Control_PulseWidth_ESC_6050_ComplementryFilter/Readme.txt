This code is used to apply the PID Algorithm for single axis (Maybe Roll or Pitch) of the Quadrotor using .writeMicroseconds function from Servo Library and complementry filter is used for MPU 6050 for calculating angles.

Components used :
Quadrotor frame
BLDC motors
ESC
Battery
MPU - 6050 as Inertial Measurement Unit
Arduino Uno as Control unit
